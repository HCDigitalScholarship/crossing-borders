### The Transatlantic Slave Trade
From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, the transatlantic slave trade transported approximately 10.7 million enslaved people from Africa to colonies in the Americas. Also known as the “triangular trade,” the process moved goods and people between three continents—Africa, America, and Europe. European traders brought goods like wine, guns, and ammunition to African trading posts, where they exchanged them for enslaved people. The traders then brought the enslaved individuals across the Atlantic on the infamous “Middle Passage,” where 20% of the Africans on board died. (An illustration of a British ship involved in the slave trade can be found in the case to your right). Finally, the traders exchanged enslaved people for American goods like cotton, tobacco, and sugar, which they then brought back to Europe. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, it is estimated that 10.7 million enslaved people were taken from Africa to colonies in the Americas. Over the course of four centuries, four million enslaved people went to Brazil, four million to Dutch American colonies, and two million to the British Caribbean. Only 388,000 (3.6%) of enslaved people taken from Africa landed in mainland North America.

### The British Slave Trade
While the first British slave trading voyage was led by John Hawkins in 1562, the British slave trade developed more fully in the 1640s and revolved around sugarcane. Britain went on to become one of the biggest slave trading nations in the world. The National Archives estimates  that the empire transported about “3.1 million Africans– of whom [only] 2.7 million arrived.” In the 1790s, attempts were made to put an end to slavery and growing disapproval of slavery eventually resulted in the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which officially outlawed the trading of enslaved people within the British Empire. Britain eventually took the next step and abolished the practice of slavery itself with the 1833 Abolition of Slavery Act.

### The Slave Trade and the United States
The first boat carrying enslaved Africans to what is now the United States arrived in the Virginia colony in 1619, shortly after Jamestown was established. After the American Revolution, the maintenance of slavery was written into the United States Constitution through the Fugitive Slave Clause, the Three-Fifths Compromise, and a clause stipulating that the government could not end slavery for at least twenty years. In 1808, Congress banned the import of foreign enslaved people, while specifying that enslaved people could still be bought and sold within the United States. However, the last ship carrying enslaved Africans to the United States arrived in Alabama in 1859, fifty-one years after the import of enslaved people had been prohibited.
