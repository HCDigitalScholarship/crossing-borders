During the abolitionist movement, literature was a common vehicle for stirring up debate and social change. As Ezra Tawil notes, abolitionist literature depicted the deplorable experiences of enslaved people in order to “engage the sympathies and move the minds of a readership who could have no experiential reference point for such a condition.”

Published in 1688, Aphra Behn’s Oroonoko has been hailed as the first literary abolitionist text. However, critics also argue that Behn’s work is not an abolitionist text due to its recurring themes of racism and anti-abolition. Similarly, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852) was seen as a moral battle cry in the quest to abolish slavery by some contemporary readers, but also received denunciation comparable to Behn’s because of the subtly racist and patronizing depictions of Black characters.

Alhough Oroonoko and Uncle Tom’s Cabin were published almost two hundred years apart, both were strong vehicles of public persuasion for abolishing slavery, intentional or not, because they communicated to their audiences the atrocities faced by enslaved people.
