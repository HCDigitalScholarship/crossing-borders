“Crossing Borders: From Slavery to Abolition, 1670-1865” was curated by the first-year writing seminar “Crossing Borders” during the fall semester of 2019. In this course, we explored geographic, linguistic, social, and racial border crossing through literature, beginning with Homer’s The Odyssey and concluding with the collaboratively-authored Refugee Tales. After reading Aphra Behn’s Oroonoko (1688), a novella about an African prince who is enslaved and transported to Suriname, we visited Quaker & Special Collections to explore books, manuscripts, and maps related to transatlantic travel, the slave trade, and abolition. We selected key items from this larger collection and worked as a class to organize and contextualize these items in the present exhibit.  

The exhibit is roughly chronological and explores the transatlantic slave trade and the development of slavery and abolition within and outside the United States. We have chosen a number of sub-themes to focus the exhibit, investigating, for example,  religion, education, and activism within the abolition movement. In particular, we foreground the experiences and perspectives of enslaved and formerly enslaved people and choose to examine rather than ignore difficult topics such as “the white savior complex” in abolition. The spatial organization of the exhibit is designed to emphasize this focus, drawing attention to the activities and narratives of people of color throughout the exhibit.
