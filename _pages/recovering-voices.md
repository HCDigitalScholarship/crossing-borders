The vast majority of historical sources regarding slavery and abolition in existence today are written by white people. When the abolition movement gained traction at the beginning of the nineteenth century, there was a call for testimonies from people who had experienced the horrors of slavery firsthand. It was difficult to access the voices of currently and formerly enslaved people because United States law prevented enslaved people from receiving an education. Despite these challenges, some enslaved people, such as Phillis Wheatley and Frederick Douglass, learned how to read and write, while other enslaved people found alternative strategies to document their lives under the slave system. An example of this is located below: Elizabeth, although unable to write, utilized her agency to dictate her story to a literate person. This person adhered to her words as closely as they could, to maintain the story’s integrity. Like Elizabeth’s memoir,  Phillis Wheatley’s poems (also featured in this exhibit) were framed by white editors.  With these limitations in mind, memoirs and written works allow us to understand the historical voices of people of color because they are the closest firsthand accounts we have of the lives that they lived under slavery.
